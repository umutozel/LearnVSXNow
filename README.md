### Part 27: [Multiple Tool Windows](http://dotneteers.net/blogs/divedeeper/archive/2008/07/25/LearnVSXNowPart27.aspx)

However Visual Studio supports multiple instances of a tool window, due to the command handling mechanism, it is a challenge to create multiple instances handling their own visual command state. In this article I show a pattern with VSXtra to cope with this issue.

I suppose, not I am the only one who can imagine a VS SDK and MPF that can be used better than the one we have today. In this post I share my thoughts about this topic. Please, share your imaginations, comments, additions and opinion with me!

## Introducing LVN! Sidebars

When writing LearnVSXNow articles and working on projects I have collected many “how-to-dos”, created small but useful code artifacts, found irritating bugs, etc. I decided to create a separate thread within the LearnVSXNow series not tied to the main stream just for publishing these small “knowledge elements”. I named this thread LVN! Sidebar. You can read the first blog posts:

### LVN! Sidebar #4: [Command handlers](http://dotneteers.net/blogs/divedeeper/archive/2008/04/06/LVNSidebar4.aspx)

### LVN! Sidebar #3: [Simplifying tool window declaration](http://dotneteers.net/blogs/divedeeper/archive/2008/03/26/LVNSidebar3.aspx)

### LVN! Sidebar #2: [Resolving string resources](http://dotneteers.net/blogs/divedeeper/archive/2008/03/24/LVNSidebar2.aspx)
